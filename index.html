                    <p>BMI is a calculated measure of body weight relative to height. CDC offers calculators to help
                        you
                        calculate BMI. For children and teens 2 through 19, use CDC's BMI Calculator for Child and
                        Teen.
                        For adults 20 and older, use CDC's Adult BMI Calculator.</p>
                    <p>To calculate BMI by hand, use the formulas below:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Metric Units: weight (kg)/[height (m)]2</li>
                        <li>Metric Units: [weight (kg)/height (cm)/height (cm)] x 10,000</li>
                        <li>U.S. Customary Units: weight (pounds)/[height (in)]2 x 703</li>

                    <p>To interpret BMI values for adults 20 and older, use standard BMI categories regardless of age,
                        sex, or race. For example, an adult who is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 200 pounds has a BMI
                        of 30.4. This BMI falls into the obesity category, defined as a BMI of 30.0 or higher. Read more

                    <p>BMI is a quick, inexpensive, and reliable screening measure to assess a person's weight relative
                        to their height. Having a BMI outside the healthy weight range can increase a person's risk for
                        certain health problems. For example, people with BMIs in the obesity category are at increased
                        risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other health problems.

                        However, BMI is just one measure of health. Consider BMI with other factorsâ€”results from a
                        physical exam, laboratory findings, health behaviors, and more. A health care provider can
                        evaluate a person to get a more complete health picture. Read more About BMI.</p>

                    <p>For adults 20 or older, enter your height and weight into CDC's Adult BMI Calculator. The tool
                        will then show your BMI and BMI category. For adults, the obesity category is defined as a BMI
                        of 30.0 or higher. Talk to your health care provider about your BMI. It may relate to your risk
                        for chronic diseases.

                        For children and teens 2 through 19 years, use CDC's Child and Teen BMI Calculator. The tool
                        will calculate BMI, BMI percentile, and BMI category. You can also view results on a growth
                        chart. For children and teens, the obesity category is defined as a BMI at or above the 95th
                        percentile for sex and age. Talk to your health care provider about your child's BMI. It may
                        relate to overall health and well-being.</p>

                    <p>For most people, BMI is a good indicator of whether they have too much or too little body fat.
                        However, BMI is not a direct measure of body fat. BMI cannot distinguish fat mass from lean body
                        mass (muscle and bone). BMI also cannot indicate where fat is located in the body.

                        BMI is moderately to strongly associated with other measures that do capture the amount, type,
                        and distribution of fat. A health care provider can help evaluate a person's health risks
                        related to their BMI and body fat.</p>
